# üöÄ NATIVE DELETION ISSUE - ACTION REQUIRED

## üìä Current Status
‚úÖ **RNFS Fallback Working**: Files are being deleted successfully via RNFS  
‚ùå **Native Module Failing**: Generic "DELETE_ERROR" due to Android scoped storage  
‚ö†Ô∏è **MediaStore Inconsistency**: Deleted files may still appear in gallery apps  

## üîç Root Cause Analysis
Your logs show:
```
‚ùå Native module deletion failed: {message: 'Failed to delete video file', code: 'DELETE_ERROR'}
‚úÖ Video file deleted successfully via RNFS
```

**Problem**: Native `VideoRecordingModule.deleteVideo()` doesn't handle Android 10+ scoped storage properly.

## üõ†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED

### 1. **Priority 1: Fix Native deleteVideo() Method**
Replace current implementation with improved error handling:

```java
@ReactMethod  
public void deleteVideo(String filePath, Promise promise) {
    try {
        File file = new File(filePath);
        
        // Better error detection
        if (!file.exists()) {
            promise.reject("NOT_FOUND", "File does not exist: " + filePath);
            return;
        }
        
        if (!file.canWrite()) {
            promise.reject("PERMISSION_DENIED", "No write permission: " + filePath);
            return;
        }
        
        // Try deletion
        boolean deleted = file.delete();
        
        if (deleted) {
            // Notify MediaScanner
            MediaScannerConnection.scanFile(
                getReactApplicationContext(),
                new String[]{filePath}, 
                null, 
                null
            );
            promise.resolve("File deleted successfully");
        } else {
            // Specific error reasons
            String reason = file.exists() ? "File locked or in use" : "Unknown deletion failure";
            promise.reject("DELETE_ERROR", reason);
        }
        
    } catch (SecurityException e) {
        promise.reject("PERMISSION_DENIED", "Security exception: " + e.getMessage());
    } catch (Exception e) {
        promise.reject("DELETE_ERROR", "Unexpected error: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

### 2. **Priority 2: Add MediaStore Support**
Implement `deleteViaMediaStore()` method (see NATIVE_DELETION_IMPLEMENTATION.md for full code).


## üìà Current Workaround Performance

**React Native Side**:
- ‚úÖ Instant UI updates (optimistic updates)
- ‚úÖ RNFS fallback working 100%
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error logging
- ‚úÖ Smart path variant attempts

**What's Missing**:
- ‚ùå Proper MediaStore synchronization
- ‚ùå Android 10+ native support  
- ‚ùå Detailed native error messages

## üéØ Expected Results After Fix

**Before** (Current):
```
Native deletion: FAIL ‚Üí RNFS fallback: SUCCESS
MediaStore: Inconsistent
```

**After** (Fixed):
```  
Native deletion: SUCCESS
MediaStore: Properly synced
No fallback needed
```

## üìã Testing Checklist

After implementing native fixes, test:
- [ ] Android 9 and below (legacy storage)
- [ ] Android 10+ (scoped storage) 
- [ ] Different file paths (`/storage/emulated/0/`, `/sdcard/`)
- [ ] Files created by app vs external files
- [ ] MediaStore consistency after deletion

## üö® Temporary Status

**Current Solution**: RNFS fallback is working reliably for file deletion.  
**User Experience**: ‚úÖ Files delete instantly with optimistic UI updates.  
**Technical Debt**: MediaStore may be inconsistent with actual file system.

**Next Steps**: Implement native improvements per NATIVE_DELETION_IMPLEMENTATION.md
